# Introduction

Stowr is an innovative proof-of-concept project that explores Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles through its implementation in Rust. This initiative emphasizes a clean separation of concerns, delineating data, behavior, and the human interface to enhance system clarity and maintainability. With characteristics reminiscent of traditional client/server architectures, Stowr organizes its codebase into distinct layers, each contained within separate crates, facilitating a modular and easily manageable structure.

Central to the design philosophy of Stowr is the expectation of loosely coupled domains that still allow for seamless integration. Each domain encapsulates a unique data concept, modeling these as structs while maintaining common behaviors across the board. This allows for a cohesive approach to handling diverse functionalities within the application.

Furthermore, the project incorporates aspects of code generation using procedural macros, streamlining development and reducing boilerplate code. The primary experiment driving Stowr is to harness the power of Rust's robust type system, aiming to provide strong data and behavior guarantees while minimizing the volume of code required. By doing so, Stowr not only seeks to enhance productivity but also aspires to create a codebase that can evolve safely over time. Rust's guarantees ensure that if the system compiles successfully, the underlying contracts are upheld, giving developers confidence in the correctness and stability of their applications. Through Stowr, we aim to redefine the boundaries of programming with Rust in a DDD context, paving the way for more reliable and maintainable software systems.
